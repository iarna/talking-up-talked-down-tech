# Prototype

The DOM is horrible. HORRIBLE. Anything was better. Deliver us from this pain. Plus cross-browser XMLHTTPRequest! And generally a better Javascript.

---

# jQuery

At first it was kind of Prototype but without the global namespace pollution.

---

# MongoDB

Key-value stores! Hey this was just a few years ago, surely you all remember this?

---

# YAML ?

# JSON ?
## Easy to read?

Hey you all remember this thing? I mean, who uses that? Ugggh. But seriously.

Title: Unpopular Tech and Why It Was AMAZING

Abstract: Turn the narrative about "crufty old legacy technology" on its
head!  From CGI scripts, to VB, from MySQL to PHP, explore why these
technologies were exciting and what led to their success.  Programming as a
profession is forward looking and this sometimes leads us to forget how much
influence theyve had on what we do today.  This talk will be half history
lesson, half cheer leading now unpopular technologies.

Ideal Audience: Less experienced folks who maybe sometimes shake their heads
and wonder why those old choices were ever even made.  More experienced
folks who want a trip down memory lane.  And everyone who wants a break from
the often relentless negativity that pervades our profession.
